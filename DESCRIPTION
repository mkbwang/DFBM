Description: This is a nonparametric denoising method that applies to sequencing count matrices such as microbiome metagenomics and single cell sequencing. The novelty of this method is to dichitomize a count matrix into binary masks with a sequence of thresholds, then apply logistic collaborative filtering to estimate a probability matrix for each binary mask. These probabilities set up an empirical CDF for each entry. The expected count is then estimated based on the empirical distribution.
